# git-tools
A collection of small tools for git

## Planned features
- Suggest commit message from "git diff --cached"
- An easier way to install

## Installation

Add the following lines to your bashrc:
```
export GIT_TOOLS_DIR=/<path-to>/git-tools/
source $GIT_TOOLS_DIR/bashrc.sh
```
(WIP I am going to create a better setup)

## Contributing

Feel free to submit PRs. I will do my best to review and merge them if I consider them essential.
